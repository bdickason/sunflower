## Will the mesh network actually grow stronger with more nodes and not just become slower?

In theory, but we need a prototype to verify this.

## Will anyone actually use a mesh network?

There are numerous mesh networks currently operating today. [The Red Hook Initiative](http://rhicenter.org/redhookwifi/) (in Brooklyn) came about when the area was battered by a hurricane. Seattle has [Hyperboria](http://tkbr.ccsp.sfu.ca/pub802/2014/01/dakrnet-the-slow-internet-movement/) which contains hundreds of active nodes that are not connected to the internet.

## Why are you just rolling it out in neighborhoods near broadband? Will this even work?

Carriers in Dallas rolled out DSL this way - with a zip code system calculating how close they your home was to their central office.
